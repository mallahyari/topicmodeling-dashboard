# Visualizing Topic Modeling using Python and React

This repo contains the code for creating a custom dashboard for visualization of topic modeling.

Here's the full article [Part 1](https://mallahyari.github.io/visualdecode/blog/exploring-data-science-job-trends-python-react-d3), and [Part 2](https://mallahyari.github.io/visualdecode/blog/exploring-data-science-job-trends-python-react-d3-part-two)

It has two directories:

- backend
- frontend

to run the backend code, simply clone this repo:

- go to the `backend/app` directory. Install all the required python packages in the `requirements.txt` file.
- run `python app/main.py`

The `model` directory inside `backend` contains a _topic model_ to be used for this app. But it can be replaced with your own topic model.

To run the frontend app:

Go to `frontend` directory and install all the packages via:
`npm install`

To run the app, from inside the `frontend` folder type:

`npm start`
